# 🚀 100 Days of Code: Full Stack Web Development Challenge

Welcome to my **#100DaysOfCode** journey!  
For the next 100 days, I’m committing to **coding every single day**, focusing entirely on **Full Stack Web Development** — from frontend design to backend logic, databases, and deployment.

---

## 🎯 Challenge Goals

- 🧠 Build a strong foundation in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
- ⚛️ Master modern **Frontend Frameworks** (React / Next.js)
- 🌐 Learn **Backend Development** with Node.js & Express
- 🗄️ Work with **Databases** (MongoDB / SQL)
- 🔗 Build and deploy **Full Stack Projects**
- 📚 Document my learning progress daily

---

## 🧩 Rules

1. **Code for at least 1 hour every day** for the next 100 days.  
2. **Post daily progress updates** in this repo (and optionally on X with `#100DaysOfCode`).  
3. **Each day’s work = one commit**, no skipping days.  
4. If I miss a day (life happens), I’ll **make it up** by doubling down the next day.  
5. Be honest and consistent — progress over perfection.
